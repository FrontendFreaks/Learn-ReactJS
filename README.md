# Master ReactJS by Building Projects

⚛️ In batch 2, we'll take a deep dive into the world of ReactJS! We'll start with the fundamentals and move on to more advanced concepts like API calls, Hooks, and higher order components.

💻 You'll get plenty of hands-on practice with 50+ assignments, including ones that companies give during their interview process.

🌟 In addition to ReactJS, we'll also cover other advanced concepts like React Router, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Redux, TypeScript, and NextJS.

🎨 And of course, we'll build five fully functional real-world projects!

👨‍💼 Plus, our top performer will get a chance to have a mock interview and a recommendation from me.

## **NOTE:**

It's important to have a solid foundation in JavaScript before diving into React. Make sure you have a good understanding of variables, data types, functions, arrays, objects, loops, and conditional statements.

If you are not sure you should choose batch 1 or batch 2. I would advise you to finish google keep clone or GitHub wrapper assignment mentioned in batch 1. If you are able to complete that, then you should choose batch 2. Otherwise learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while solving 20+ assignment.

  </a>
</div>

### Task 1:

1. Add a reset button that resets the counter back to zero
2. Add a feature that allows the user to increment/decrement the counter by a custom value (e.g., 5 or 10)
3. Add a feature that allows the user to change the color of the counter based on its value (e.g., green for positive values, red for negative values).
4. Design your first app, and share the code sandbox link in google sheet for tracking your progress.
5. 🚀 Don't forget to share your learning and assignments on LinkedIn and Twitter using **#FrontendWithVishal** to showcase your skills to potential employers!

### Task 2:

1. Let's head over to the official documentation of ReactJS and read the Describing the UI section in its entirety. We covered these topics in the previous video, but developing the habit of reading documentation is essential to becoming a skilled developer. 📖🤓

<div align="center">

</div> 

2. At the end of each article, you'll find a few challenges to tackle. These challenges will help solidify your understanding of the concepts and make it easier to remember the code syntax. There are a total of 22 challenges spread across 8 articles. 🧐💻

</div> 

3. How do you feel after completing these challenges? Did reading the official ReactJS documentation make it easier to understand the technology? Share your experiences and learning journey on LinkedIn and Twitter using the hashtag #FrontendWithVishal to inspire others to learn from the official documentation too. 🤝🚀

### Task 3:

1. Did you understand how ReactJS renders components? Take a moment to explain the concepts of **Triggering** a render, **Rendering** the component, and **Committing** to the DOM in a LinkedIn post or Twitter thread with a helpful image. Don't forget to use the hashtag #frontendwithVishal. 
    
**NOTE:** Understanding how React components render will help you grasp advanced topics in ReactJS and make debugging your code much easier. So, this task is a must-do! 🤔👨‍💻
