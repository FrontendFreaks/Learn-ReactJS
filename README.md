# Master ReactJS by Building Projects

⚛️ In batch 2, we'll take a deep dive into the world of ReactJS! We'll start with the fundamentals and move on to more advanced concepts like API calls, Hooks, and higher order components.

💻 You'll get plenty of hands-on practice with 50+ assignments, including ones that companies give during their interview process.

🌟 In addition to ReactJS, we'll also cover other advanced concepts like React Router, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Redux, TypeScript, and NextJS.

🎨 And of course, we'll build five fully functional real-world projects!

👨‍💼 Plus, our top performer will get a chance to have a mock interview and a recommendation from me.

## **NOTE:**

It's important to have a solid foundation in JavaScript before diving into React. Make sure you have a good understanding of variables, data types, functions, arrays, objects, loops, and conditional statements.

If you are not sure you should choose batch 1 or batch 2. I would advise you to finish google keep clone or GitHub wrapper assignment mentioned in batch 1. If you are able to complete that, then you should choose batch 2. Otherwise learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while solving 20+ assignment.
